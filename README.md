# PiFace: The Raspberry PA-Pi Competition 2024/5


## **Summary**
PiFace plans to bring security to every doorstep. It uses AI and facial recognition to identify people to open your main door, via a tiny servo. It can be controlled and monitored via an app, save recognised faces and keeps privacy and accessibility at the forefront of its design for disabled and able-bodied users alike.
We care about your data and convenience - the AI is trained to work while disconnected from WiFi using OpenCV, and all AI data is stored on-device forever.
In addition, the cost of PiFace is minimal, simply being below Â£75 - less than the cost of a Ring doorbell.
Of course, PiFace uses a RF Receiver and Transceiver operating on 433.92MHz as a normal doorbell to quickly notify residents of the house.
And we're just getting started. We plan to add more modules, such as a feature allowing you to authorise friends and family to open the door. We even plan to add a mic/speaker combo to allow you to talk to visitors. Stay tuned!

## Installation

- Install the following dependencies in a virtual enviroment by running the following commands:

`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` 

`sudo apt install python3-opencv python3-picamera2 -y  #`

`pip install face-recognition numpy dlib imutils  `

`pip install smtplib email  `

`pip install RPi.GPIO gpiozero ` 

`sudo raspi-config  `

`sudo reboot  `

- Transfer at minimum 100 photos to the "photos" folder.
- Run the `training.py` script and wait for it to finish training the AI. A file named `trained.pickle` will be created.
- To setup email, replace the `from_email_addr`, `to_email_addr` and `from_email_pass` with their corresponding credentials.
- On the receiver, install the same dependencies [albeit opencv and face-recognition related libs] and run `receiver.py`.
- You're done! Congratulations, and enjoy PiFace.
